## Description

I initially developed this app as a team leader for a final project in a computer science senior capstone course taught by [Dr. Jeret Langston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaretlangston/) at [UAB](https://www.uab.edu/) with the help of Steven Capleton, Landon Dyken, Karen Horton, Brittany Latham, and Laura Thompson.

This app is a Python/React webapp that simulates a smarthome control and analysis dashboard program based on [this project description](project_description.pdf)
