# Team Norms

## Team 3

- Steven Capleton
- Landon Dyken
- Karen Horton
- Eric Latham
- Brittany Latham
- Laura Thompson

### Norm #0

Our team will use the following mediums to communicate:

- Microsoft Teams for team meetings and pair programming
- Telegram for group text conversations
- Shortcut (PKA Clubhouse) for task documentation and progress tracking
- Descriptive commit messages on GitLab

### Norm #1

Our team will partner up on tasks and do pair programming as much as possible.

### Norm #2

In addition to attending weekly lab meetings, our team will have weekly team meetings via Microsoft Teams at 2-3pm on Mondays.

Weekly meetings will be a chance to review team progress, demo important changes, and discuss future tasks.

### Norm #3

The way our team will resolve differences within the team is through votes, polls, and chats via Telegram.

### Norm #4

When an individual in the team is upset with someone else in the team they should initially work on handling the issue among themselves. If the issue is not resolved and is brought to the entire team, our team will meet on Microsoft Teams to have a face-to-face conversation about it.

### Norm #5

In our team, we will refrain from sharing our team's code with other groups.

### Norm #6

In our team, the maximum amount of time acceptable for a team member not to respond to their teammates is **24 hours**, but **12 hours** is preferred.

### Norm #7

In our team, each team member will always start working on their assigned task **as soon as possible**; starting the day a task is assigned is highly encouraged.

### Norm #8

In our team, each team member will always ask for help **as soon as possible**; we will never wait to ask for help until after a deadline has passed.

### Norm #9

In our team, each team member will practice the following habits with respect to GitLab and team coordination:

- always work off of the `working` branch of the project repository (unless special feature branches are assigned for different tasks)
- always `git pull` before working in the project repository
- always write descriptive commit messages before pushing changes
- always notify the team via Telegram when pushing changes

### Norm #10

One way our team will show recognition or appreciation is whenever a team member pushes a change to the project repository and notifies the team on Telegram, the team will congratulate and/or thank them for their contribution.

Another way our team will show recognition of a team member's work is by reviewing merge requests for stories linked on Shortcut and leaving constructive comments afterward.

### Norm #11

If a member is not carrying their load within the team, our team will meet on Microsoft Teams to discuss reasons why the team member is struggling, assist them as a team, and possibly adjust team assignments.

### Norm #12

In our team, major submission drafts will be shared with the entire team **48 hours** before the actual course deadline.

### Norm #13

If a member misses an agreed-upon internal team deadline, our team will do the following:

- If it's the first offense:
  - Record the details of the offense
  - Reinforce that next time the deadline should be met
  - Ask if the team member needs help understanding/implementing something
    - Assist the team member as a team or subgroup if needed
- If it's a repeated offense:
  - Record the details of the offense
  - Notify the professor
  - Shift task assignments to more reliable team members
  - Adjust the team member's contribution percentage

### Norm #14

If a member turns in poor quality of work, our team will do the following:

- Acknowledge the effort and any positives in the work first
- Give constructive criticism and clarify the team's expectations
- Explain _why_ another approach/solution might be better, easier, or more beneficial for the team

### Norm #15

If the Team Leader is not functioning effectively, our team will discuss the concern together on Microsoft Teams and find a solution within **24 hours**. We will ask the Team Leader if they are having difficulty performing the assigned duties. If the answer is yes, the team will pull together and help the Team Leader within reason or ask for a new Team Leader volunteer. If the answer is no, the Team Leader will be informed of exactly how they are failing and given **24 hours** to rectify the situation. If they do not rectify the situation within **24 hours**, the professor will be notified and the Team Leader will be replaced.

### Norm #16

Tasks will be split on a mostly democratic basis; team members will have reasonable freedom to choose tasks they want to work on.

### Norm #17

If a team member has any doubts or concerns about the team or the project, they should bring up to the group in Telegram within **24 hours**.
